# Welcome to Tiki Game Jam 2015!

This is where all the stuff we write will get stored, so it's publicly available and won't go away.

You do not need to do anything here to be part of the fun. But if you want to, you can do cool stuff.

# Editing files in github

Signing in to github will let you make simple changes to files right in the github website. If you don't have an account, it's free and they don't spam you, just click the sign up link that's probably floating near the top right of the page you're currently reading.

To edit a file, navigate to and click on the file you want to change. You should see an edit icon, click that.

When you're done making changes, say what you did in the box under "Commit changes" below and click the big button to save.

# Using Unity

Unity is free and lets you do everything, it's not just for coders.

To use Unity you'll need to be able to get the updates from GitHub, and the easiest way to do that is to install a git client. If you're using Windows, easiest is to grab GitHub for Windows here: https://windows.github.com/

Once you install, ask someone to get you started. It's not difficult at all but it's not self-explanatory either, and really I don't want to type it all.

Then grab Unity Personal Edition from here: http://unity3d.com/get-unity

Install and launch, yay!

Seriously, it's not just for coders.

# Fun stuff

Here is a great Unity tutorial for making a Pacman clone: http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game
